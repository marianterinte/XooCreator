A simple and child-friendly blueprint-style drawing of a generic cartoon animal body, placed only on the left side of the image canvas. The rest of the canvas (right side) is completely blank white, making the body appear as if it occupies half of a vertical composition. The body is rounded, cute, and softly detailed, with no arms, legs, head, or tail—just the central torso. The lines are light blue, resembling blueprint style, and the design is clean and minimal, ideal for children’s educational or creative materials. Square format 1024x1024.
